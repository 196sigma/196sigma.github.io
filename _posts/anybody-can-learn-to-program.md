## Anybody Can Learn to Program
Reginald Edwards, PhD
April 2020


“[E]arly acts of literacy were closely tied to power and chiefly used for management practices, and probably less than 1% of the population was literate, as it was confined to a very small ruling elite.”

### You do not remember how long it took you and how difficult it was for you to learn how to read.
The UN gives the cutoff for adult literacy at 15 years old. And in rich countries a substantial part of a child’s education over those 15 years is devoted to teaching her to read and write. 15 years! While most children begin first grade being able to read and write, the reading and writing abilities of a five-year-old are nothing to admire. We give them time. The typical length of an adult education course, college course, or MOOC designed to teach programming concepts varies from about six weeks to a semester. Kindergarteners may spend three months on “A is for ‘APPLE’”. Speaking (merely one aspect of language acquisition) comes naturally to Homo Sapiens, reading and writing do not.

### Do children learn more easily than adults?
What seems to account for the apparent difference between the learning ability of children and young adults and adults is the expectations, patience, and learning environment[citation needed]. Babies, toddlers, and young children are treated with tremendous patience and care as they gradually acquire the skills needed to read and write, such that they have a basic literacy by their fifth or sixth birthday. An incoming college freshman with no prior programming experience; with social, hormonal, and financial pressures is expected to be essentially fluent in programming by her third (Junior) year.[cite curriculum at a typical US university] An adult with all such pressures magnified would be expected to be competent after a six week MOOC. We have our expectations exactly in reverse.

### Is mathematics education enough prerequisite for programming? 
We spend tremendous resources in primary and secondary school on teaching children math. Is this enough of a foundation such that any differences in programming ability must be innate and thus insurmountable? I argue no. Anecdotally, there are many examples of programmers who are bad at math, and mathematicians who can’t program. The mathematician and former code-breaker James Simons, who also happens to have founded the most successful quantitative hedge fund in history, is an informative case study:

In 1955, when Simons was seventeen, he enrolled at M.I.T. and fell in love with mathematics. He received his Ph.D. at U.C. Berkeley, when he was twenty-three. Soon, he was working at the federally funded Institute for Defense Analyses, in its élite cryptography group, which is based in Princeton. “Our job was to break other countries’ codes and to design our own,” Simons said. “I was lucky enough to do some very good mathematics while I was there, and I enjoyed coming up with an algorithm and seeing it tested on a computer. I couldn’t program to save my life, but I did solve a long-standing problem in the field.

Mathematics is not a sufficient baseline for learning to code. Programming is a skill unto itself that must be cultivated over a long period of time.


### Where does the narrative that some people are just not able to code come from?
The experiences of many teachers of undergraduate programming seem to validate the idea that some students “just can’t get it.” However, as I pointed out above, expecting a pre-novice college freshman to become essentially proficient over the course of a semester and judging the mass of humanity’s intrinsic ability to learn this skill on the success and failure of these students is inappropriate. The conclusions in such studies (e.g, http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf) wildly overstep the bounds of the empirical evidence, such as it is. Moreover, the resignation that certain groups “just can’t get it” smacks of fatalism. It is more appropriate to view the task of programming education as an engineering problem to be solved, not an immalleable feature of the universe. Human brains do not differ in such profound ways. The mere fact that so many students do learn to program is evidence enough that most people can learn to program. Whatever programming ability is acquired is unlikely to be the result of evolutionary pressure over our 500,000 years of existence, thus it is unlikely to be truly and completely innate. Until such time as biologists identify a programming gene, our maintained assumption must be that the failure of some students to learn to code is a failure of society to teach them. There is always a role for personal effort (laziness) and ability in learning, but the dumbest, laziest person you know knows how to read and write.

### Why does it seem like some people take to programming much more readily than others?
There are a host of social, environmental, and cognitive factors that may explain the observed discrepancy in the rate at which people learn to program. Just as there are with any unnatural skill. Many of these factors are unobserved, unobservable, and not available even to the students themselves. Geoff Colvin in Talent is Overrated, draws on numerous case studies of presumed “natural” geniuses such as Mozart and Tiger Woods to show how early, consistent exposure and deliberate practice over many hours (the “10,000 hour” rule) explains much of their success. Early exposure to programming concepts (such as assignment rules) and consistent, deliberate practice will not turn every person into a world-class programmer (just as early exposure and consistent, deliberate practice has not produced a global population of Hemingways) but it could move a large fraction of the population to competence. 

### Should everyone learn to program?
Whether or not everyone should learn to code is a contentious issue. My arguments above take no stance. My personal bias is that yes--there are likely benefits to society at large and to individuals in learning to manipulate symbols on a computer, automate, and express ideas programmatically. To the extent that we think logical thinking is important, and we have since at least the time of Aristotle, programming makes bad reasoning impossible. Computers will do only what you tell them to do, not what you mean[citation for this quote]. Does learning to program cause one to think more logically? I do not know, but my prior would be high that it does. If a program works it is not wrong and if it does not work it is wrong. 

### Recommendations
The argument that not everyone can learn to code is pernicious and untenable based on the available evidence. My recommendations are twofold.

First, we should measure grade level in coding ability, not look at it at a binary ability. Second, we should start computational thinking and programming early, not because it is hard or children learn better, but because it takes a while to learn such an unnatural skill. Getting the bulk of humanity to a level equivalent to the reading ability of a 1st grade american student would be a remarkable and worthwhile accomplishment.
